## Configuration

Add to `config/config.php`:

```php
'globalquota' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'quota_bytes' => 500 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // 500 GB
],
```

---

## OCC Commands

```bash
# Set quota (in bytes)
occ globalquota:set 2147483648   # 2 GB

# Check status
occ globalquota:status

# Force recalculation
occ globalquota:recalc
```

---

## API Endpoints

```bash
# Get current status (new endpoint for admin chart)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     https://instance.com/apps/globalquota/status

# Legacy API v1 endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     https://instance.com/apps/globalquota/api/v1/status

# Update quota
curl -X PUT \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"quota_bytes": 10737418240}' \
     https://instance.com/apps/globalquota/api/v1/quota
```

---

## Upload Blocking

When the global quota is exceeded, the app will:
- Block new file uploads
- Block file updates that increase size
- Return HTTP 507 "Insufficient Storage" error
- Work with all clients (web, desktop, mobile, WebDAV)

---

## Visualization Modes (v1.2.0)

### ðŸ”— With ServerInfo
If ServerInfo supports events (`LoadAdditionalDataEvent`), GlobalQuota **replaces the Disk chart** with GlobalQuota data.

### ðŸ“Š Standalone
If ServerInfo does not support events, GlobalQuota shows its **own donut chart** in the Admin Settings section.

Both modes display:
- Usage percentage
- Used / Free / Total values
- Auto-refresh capability (via API)

---

## Requirements

- Nextcloud 25+
- Admin privileges for configuration
- Optional: ServerInfo app (for dashboard integration)
